# ML-Adventure

This is a repository that

I use to add my practiced codes on machine learning algorithm and 

I will add them as I learn more in the pass of machine learning adventure

The codes will be in PYTHON

At first I focus on learning algorithms without any advanced Machine Learning library

but I will use Numpy, numpy,etc 

then as I Learn more in this pass

I may use some advanced libraries like sklearn , etc.
